The concept of array comprehension in CoffeeScript is to assemble a new array quickly from an existing array, it is used to map an array of objects to another array. This essentially helps to simplify the code and make it more readable and clean. 

Ex: 

We have a bakery that has its products on an object with their name, size, and price. We want to print all our products without the size and the price, so we would use list comprehension to print out the names of all our products. This can be done for any instance in the object, in this case with either name, size, or price. Array comprehension is used to divide and sort information/data in order to be able to analyze it effectively to create a reduction in certain information. 

##Included file with runnable script in gradescope

# Object of products and their information for the bakery
Menu = [
    {name: 'Chocolate Chip Cookie', size: 1, price: 4}
    {name: 'Sugar Cookie', size: 1, price: 3}
    {name: 'Brownie Fudge', size: 2, price: 5}
    {name: 'Chocolate Cake', size: 7, price: 21}
    {name: 'Vanilla Cake', size: 7, price: 22}]

name_products = (x.name for x in Menu)
console.log name_products # print all product names

size_1 = (x.name for x in Menu when x.size == 1)
console.log size_1 # Print products that are for a single person

size_big = (x.name for x in Menu when x.size > 1)
console.log size_big # Print products that are for a group of people
