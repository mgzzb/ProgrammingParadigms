            <p> I assist my Notre Dame classmates, faculty and staff with computing and technology issues or questions. I troubleshoot over 20 clients a day with issues related to network connectivity,
              Windows and Mac Operating Systems and applications including (but not limited to) MS Office, Google Apps, Adobe Creative Suite, browsers, and antivirus software. Adding on, I work with
              customers on their personal device to solve issues with Okta, email, calendar, printing and the vpn. Along with assisting customers with personal issues, I also perform monetary transactions
            for the purchases of print quota, SD cards, audio/visual equipment, storage devices and rental of computers. </p>

            <h3 class = "text_headers2" >Innovation Technology Intern</h3>

            <p> Over summer 2022, I worked as an Intern in Arca Continental, a Beverage Company in Mexico. They are a multinational company that produces, distributes, and markets beverages under The Coca-Cola Company brand, as well as snacks under the Bokados brand in Mexico, Inalecsa in Ecuador, and Wise and Deep River in the United States. At my three months in Arca Continental I was able to work in over 6 projects. I coded in Python an interactive chatbot using WhatsApp API and worked with Jelou to implement the product in customer services. I also researched different augmented reality tools that have been develop recently and tried to find how we could apply this new tools (such as Microsoft Guides with Hololens) to assist and facilitate the tasks of the company. After analyzing different technologies we proceeded to test out the Hololenses and how they could facilitate training and the daily life of a plant worker. I was also responsible for conceptualing a vending machine tracking program to track inventory and be able to optimize our sales and work more efficienctly.
