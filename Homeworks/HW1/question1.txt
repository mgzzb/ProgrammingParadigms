In the code, you have an output of "undefined" in line 13 instead of "Negative" because you are storing the value "Negative" in the variable result which is being defined with let. If you define a variable with let you will only be able to use the variable inside the block (loop/statement). So, when we leave the if statement we no longer have access to the variable result that was originally given the value "Negative". When we lose access to the string, the output ends up being undefined because the code can not read what is stored in the result, it does not even recognize the variable.
