# Programming Paradigms

Homeworks and Activities for my Programming Paradigms class. 


Course Objectives:

- Comprehend the differences and commonalities across functional, imperative, declarative, and object-oriented programming paradigms and their principles.
- Develop a greater understanding of the issues involved in programming language design and implementation, such as static vs dynamic typing, data manipulation, strong vs weak typing, passing by value vs reference, callback, currying, and syntactic sugar.
- Develop an understanding of how different paradigms manifest in different architectures, such as client-server architecture, RESTful web services, and multithreaded architecture and languages.
- Implement several programs in languages other than the one emphasized in the core curriculum (Java/Python/Clojure/JavaScript/CoffeeScript/Ruby).
- Develop an understanding of the compilation and interpretation processes.
- Be able to compose abstractions for each studied programming paradigm and critically evaluate and recommend the most appropriate paradigm and language for a new problem.
