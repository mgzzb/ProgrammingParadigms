Explain why when the CoffeeScript code snippet shown in the first column is executed it has the output shown in the second column.

The CoffeeScript code works in print1() and not in print2() because of how the functions are using the arrows. The arrows -> and => have different meanings. With print2() the innerFN is using "->" which is what is causing the type error. We need to change the arrow in the print2: () innerFn to be "=>" in order for the function to work properly. Once we make the change we will avoid the single arrow "->" to try to takeover the value of "this" or "@" in the context of the function. 

Below is the code from the print function fixed:

print2: () =>
        console.log "print2 = (#{@x},#{@y})"
        innerFn = () => (console.log "inner in print2 = (#{@x},#{@y})" ) 
        innerFn()
