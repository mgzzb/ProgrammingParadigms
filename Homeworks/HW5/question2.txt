Why is it generally a good idea to place the CSS <link> between <head></head> and JS <script> directly before </body>?

It is generally a good idea to place the CSS <link> between <head></head> because HTML will read the program line by line from top to bottom when it builds the website. This being said, it is convenient to add the CSS <link> in the area of the head in order to make sure that when styling and formatting your <body></body> you have the tools necessary to do so. When adding the CSS <link> you are allowing the html file to access your styling preferences, and to properly load the page, you should make sure to read and load the CSS <link> before trying to use it.Then, we should have the JS <script> directly before </body> because we want to display the website and then take into consideration our JS file. JavaScript can sometimes delay or block pages from loading when you include the file in an HTML file. So, if you place it at the end you have less risk, but you still allow the program to be connected to your JS file.
